I download ahk-mode.el from
http://gist.github.com/194210

and download cyntax/* from
https://github.com/tinku99/ahk-org-mode/tree
ahk-org-mode is a cool thing ,but it has a problem ,so I don't use it anymore
and download autocomplete/ahk-org-mode
from 
https://github.com/tinku99/ahk-org-mode/tree
and rename it to ahk-mode ,and put it under  auto-complete-dict/
